		</p>
		<ul class="bulletpoints">

		</ul>		
		<p class="contenttext">For the application to work you either need a 3G connection of need to be connected to Wifi. The application will not give you any information when connected with 2G because of the limitation with 2G. The 2G networks disconnect the internet as soon as the call comes in. This application needs internet to resolve the call as the call comes in and thus 3G or Wifi connection is mandatory.</p>
		<p class="contenttext">When the call comes from MCube then the below screen pops up with the call showing the Caller’s Number, If the Caller’s Number along with the name is in the contact list of MCube then the Name will appear in the second line. The third line “Sales track New” is the name associated to the number advertised.</p>
