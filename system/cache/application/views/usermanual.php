			<p class="contentsubhead">Enhancements made in September 2013 Release :</p>
			<p class="contenttext">
				<p>1. Employee Break has been introduced which allows an employee to go offline for a break. Once an employee is on break, he/she will not receive any calls. In the ‘List Employee’ section there a new action icon which shows if the employee/executive is on break  or not.<br/>
				An employee can put himself on break. There is an option ‘offline‘ when you click on the login name at the right hand corner of the screen,below the 'Change Password'. This option changes to ‘online’ once the employee is on a break and can click on it to become available again.  <br/>
				A new widget on the Dashboard shows the employees currently on break. A ‘break History’ report is also available in the Reports section.<br/>
				<img src="system/application/img/icons/offline.png"/>  :  Denotes the 'Offline/Break' Employee.<br/>
				<img src="system/application/img/icons/online.png"/>  :  Denotes the 'Online' Employee.<br/>
				</p>
				<p><b>An employee break  is valid only for Mcube Track and not for IVRS or Mcube X</b></p>
				<p>2. All the Inactive Employees are shown in RED. This works both when an employee is disabled from the employee section and also when an employee is disabled from the group.</p>
				<p>3. An SMS can be sent to employees directly from the employee panel. This is available as an action icon.</p>
				<!--<p>4. 'Click to Call' Option added to Employee on List employees 'Action' Column. This means when the click to call happened, the 'RED CROSS' mark listed employee will be assigned for the call</p>-->
			</p>
			<p class="contentsubhead" id="2">Packages</p>

			<p class="contenttext">The package concept is directed to streamline the  range of services offered for a particular number against the price a customer is paying.  You need admin login to configure it.</p>

			<p class="contenttext">A landing number is associated with a group. While configuring the group, you can choose various options like missed call, record conversation, SMS sent to customer etc. These options are decided based on the package you purchased.</p>

			<p class="contenttext">Add on packages are available if your package is not a default packegr.</p>
				
			<p class="contenttext">Each landing number from the backend is assigned to one of the services (MCube Track, MCube X, MCube IVRS) purchased by you. This landing number will then be mapped to a group within the service by you. When configuring the group for MCube Track or MCube IVRS or MCube X you will setup the options that suite your requirement and when you select landing number the available number for this service will appear. If the number is already in use it will not show during setup of the group. When you select the number some options may not appear. This will depend on the package purchased by you.</p>

			<p class="contenttext">Therefore, when a number is being assigned to you VMC Admin will assign a package to go with it. She/He will also ensure that there are different numbers for call track, IVRS and PBX. One number cannot have all three.</p>
			<p class="contentsubhead" id="2">Mcube Track</p>
			<p class="contenttext">VMC's MCube Track is an easy to use Hosted Solution that can track incoming phone calls back to the its origination or source. The analytics will reveal effectiveness by telling you the number of calls generated for a campaign or source. There are no expensive equipment or software required to use powerful features of MCubeTrack.</p>

			<p class="contenttext">MCube Track will automatically track and forward the call coming against each landing number, record the caller's number, time at which call came, duration of the call. If the caller calls more than one then the call gets forwarded to the sales agent that spoke to the caller earlier (If Sticky caller option has been selected). Sales agent can then enter rest of the information like caller name, caller email, remarks of the call etc. to qualify the call. </p>

			<p class="contenttext">The reports have been broken into qualified calls, unqualified calls and missed calls and follow up with your team to get any details and track how sales agents are performing against leads assigned to them and track how each campaign is doing and how many calls have been recorded against each campaign.</p>

			<p class="contenttext">Users of the system can convert selected calls to leads and the calls will start showing in the leads module. This will allow your business to segregate the good calls that can generate potential business from calls that may not generate immediate business for you.</p>

			<p class="contenttext">MCube allows you to add customized fields to call reports or lead reports so you can enter customized data for incoming calls. In some ways MCube Panel will work like a mini CRM for pre-sales management.</p>

			<p class="contenttext">MCube also gives you ability to callback the clients number using “Click2Call” option against each call. On clicking the call will first connect the logged in agent and then the customer. If the customer picks up then the both can talk otherwise the call gets disconnected. You will need to buy MCube Credits for this feature. Please contact our sales team to know how to buy these credits.</p> 
			
			<p class="contentsubhead" id="2">CallTrack Groups </p> 

			<p class="contenttext">CallTrack groups are identifiers for each call source and a landing number is associated to the group. Each group has employees who will attend calls coming in from the associated landing number. Each employee may work certain hours or serve certain region and based on the time of the work and region they serve the incoming call will be connected to the employees within the group. To be able to take call the employee should be confirmed employee and not disabled. If you observe an employee is not getting calls then check the following:
			<ul class="bulletpoints">
					<li> Employee should not be disabled. Go to employee listing and check for lock sign against the employee.</li>
					<li>The employee working hours fall within the time at which the call is coming. Go to employee listing click on employee to check the hours employee works.</li>
					<li>If the employee is not in the employee list then employee has not confirmed, go to uncomfirmed employee list and if the employee is present in this list then ask the employee to confirm from its email.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="contenttext">The employees with in group will receive calls based on routing algorithm selected, there are two different rules, to route the calls to employees.
				<ul class="bulletpoints">
					<li>Sequential: The call will be routed to employees in sequential order which employees are added</li>
					<li>Weighted: Based on the priority or weight-age which we will assign to group employees, call will be route to that.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p class="contenttext">Every group contains one Group Owner. The Group Owner will act as a 'Fail over'. means, if no one picks up the call, default it will go to the Group Owner.( Even if he is NOT shown in the employee list of the group.). You can configure such that group owner does not get a call.</p>
			<p class="contenttext"><b>Fail Over:</b> If we have assign or group to “Fail over”, that list of employees will not comes under the call routing system, If all the employees of call routing or diverting are not able to receive the call, that time Fail over employee list will get call(as group rules, it may be sequential or weighted). </p>
			<p class="contenttext">If none of the fail over employees pick up the call then the call goes to the Group owner, if this person is also does not pick the call, then the call will go to voice mail if voice mail option is selected otherwise the call will disconnect and call is reported as missed call.</p>
			<p class="contentsubhead" id="2">New CallTrack Group:</p> 
			<p class="contenttext">Business users can Add groups, with mapping of landing number.<br/>
			<img src="system/application/img/icons/addgroup_g.png"/><br/>

			<p class="contenttext"><b>Region: </b>Location of the business, means under which region the numbers or network comes.
<p class="contenttext"><b>Business Days and Hours:</b> Availability of days and time of that group for the business
ex: The corporate company is opened only Monday to Friday , need to check those days, and put the timings. After that the group calls will routed to employee which is assigned or message will come, or it will disconnect. Note: If no one gets calls at a certain time of day then check this setting within the group.</p>
<p class="contenttext"><b>URL: </b></p>

<p class="contenttext"><b>Group Rules:</b></p>
<p class="contenttext"><b>Sequential:  </b>This is a procedure how the calls will be assigned to the employees in that group. Sequential rule means the calls will be connected to the employees which we will create one by one.</p>

<p class="contenttext"><b>Weighted: </b>In this rule calls will be assigned to the employees based on the “Employee weight” entered in the Add employee to Group form.</p>
If the list of employees are having same weight number means, those all comes under one level, and sequential method will apply here.</p>

<p class="contenttext"><b>Action perform on Connect:</b> You can provide API for us to call as soon as call connect happens in this group. This can be used to integrate with 3rd party application and provide data in realtime.</p>

<p class="contenttext"><b>Action perform on Hangup: </b>You can provide API for us to call as soon as call hangup event happens in this group. This can be used to integrate with 3rd party application and provide data in realtime.</p>

    <p class="contentsubhead">Enhancements made in September 2013 Release :</p>
	<p class="contenttext">
		<p>1. New Algorithm for groups has been introduced , i.e. Priority Algorithm. It gives the sequential call folw to executives, in order every time.<br/>
		Example:<br/>
		If Executive A Priority - 1<br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive B Priority - 2<br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive C Priority - 3<br/>
		Then every time call comes in it should first try executive A then executive B then executive C in order for every call.
		<p>2. A new checkbox ‘Action perform on Convert As Lead’ is also available while configuring groups to hook an api call when a lead is converted.</p>

		<p class="contenttext">MCubeX  is a virtual PBX system. It is hosted on the Mcube platform  and  lets you have a business phone system without having to invest in the expensive switching equipment. You have the flexibility of adding both landline and mobile numbers in the PBX. Also, since it is virtual you can have one phone system for multiple locations.</p>
		<p class="contenttext"><b>New McubeX:</b></p>
		<p class="contenttext">We can Map the assigned landing number to create new PBX system, the mapping will be taken care by our end.
		
		<img src="system/application/img/icons/newmx.png"/>

		<p class="contenttext"><b>PBX Title	 :</b>  Name to identify PBX Group, you need to define a title/name of that PBX. </p>

			<ul class="bulletpoints">
				<li>Once a call comes on the landing number configured for PBX, the recorded message is  played ( if the recorded file is uploaded).</li> 
				<li>It waits for the caller to punch-in the extension number. If a valid extension number is input, the call will be transferred to the number configured for that employee. The first extension is NOT preceded by a “*” or a “#” sign. For subsequent transfers the extension number has to be preceded by either “*” [the present extension will not be disconnected] or “#” [the present extension will be disconnected].</li>
				<li>If not a valid extension number it gets transferred to the PBX Operator.</li>
				<li>The directory services can be used if the caller doesn’t know the extension number. To access Directory services, ‘1’ has be pressed. Then the caller will be prompted to press the first three characters of the name of the person he wants to connect to. All the names corresponding to this input will be available for selection one by one. If there are no names corresponding to the input, the call will be routed to the operator.</li> 
				<li>If the direct operator is enabled, all the calls are routed directly to the operator and no input is accepted. Directory services will also not work in this case.</li>
				<li>Any of the employees can also be made the PBX operator by clicking at the action icon against the employee extension in the McubeX. Then this employee will act as the direct operator.</li>

			From | Group | To | Date Time | Duration | Name | Address | Email | Remarks<br/>
			The records displayed in all these reports are the same, only it’s easier to find specific information. <br/>
			In addition, the user has an option of creating and saving  his own customized reports. The customized reports can be created and saved in the ‘Advanced Search’ . Once these reports are saved they will come up as tabs in the report section along with ‘All’,’Basic’, ‘Contact’.<br/>
			For example: “Last 7 Days” is the one in below screen.<br/><br/>
			<img src="system/application/img/icons/reports-ui.jpeg" />
			<p>2. New fields added to the Track Report: Some new fields like duration, Reference id and Unique id have to added to the report. Duration is the time in seconds for which the call was made. Earlier the time was only reported in pulse. Unique id an automatically generated sequential number assigned  to every incoming call .It’s unique and  not editable/changeable. Reference id is also similar and by default it is same as the unique id but this field is editable so the executive could put any reference id to identify this call .</p>
			<p>3. Advance search: A new ‘Advance Search’ is available in the search section. This allows more flexibility as it offers users to put in their customized filters. This search can also be saved as a customized report.<br/>
			The three main reports, Track report, IVRS Report, McubeX  report and the Leads module  have an ‘Advanced search’ tab  in the search option. <br/>
			This option allows the user more options to narrow the search or to design a specific report [by saving the search as a report]. <br/>
			The report offers Time filters like All, today, last 7 days or this month.<br/>
			Group and employee selection <br/>
			It also has an option to add a ‘AND’ or ‘OR’ condition on all the fields of that report.<br/>
			<img src="system/application/img/icons/advsearch.jpeg"/>
			</p>
			<p>4. Bulk download: Bulk download option in the report allows downloading only the selected records.</p>
			<p>5. Convert lead/Update Lead: This option is now available as a checkbox on edit action on a call. Once checked , the user can covert this call into a lead and assign it either to a group or an employee. All calls converted into leads are visible in green color. For more details see the Leads Management section.</p>
			<p>6. Remark History: Earlier the remarks entered against a particular call were not visible in the next call from the same number. Now a remark history is maintained where all the remarks from the previous calls  from the same number are appended and  visible in the lastest call from the same number.</p>

	<p class="contenttext">Leads Module is the Module to revise the Pre-sale information or convert the existing calls as leads.<br/>
		Leads can be added to this module either manually by executives/employees (upload option available if the number of leads is more) or existing call in the system can be converted as leads. <br/>
		A concept of Leads group similar to the groups in call track is introduced. This group is specific to the leads section and contains employees/executives.<br/>
		A lead can be assigned to either an employee or to a group. Bulk assignment of leads is also possible.
		If bulk leads are assigned to a group, the group rule (sequential or weighed) decides how the leads are distributed among the employees of the group.<br/><br/>
		<b>Lead Groups:</b><br/>
		The Lead group is as same as call track group. The Employees/ Executives will come under groups. The lead groups has two basic rules i.e sequential and weighted. According to this rule or algorithm the employees will be assign to leads. <br/><br/>

	 <p class="contenttext">
		 Convert lead option is available as a checkbox in  Reports->Manage incoming caller ->Update the details section. Once this box is checked, an option will be available to either assign it to an individual employee or to a group. There is also an option to send an alert via email, sms or both to the employee/group that is being assigned the lead.<br/>

		 <b>Convert as lead or Update as lead</b><br/>
		 When a lead is converted, the option of convert lead in the call track report will change to update lead. Any changes made in the call report( like the remarks field ) will be reflected in the leads section if the ‘update lead’ checkbox is checked.<br/>
		 A call is associated with an incoming number, group.<br/>
		 A lead is also associated with an incoming number, employee and a leads group.<br/>
		 After a lead is converted, another call from the same incoming number can come into the system.
		 <ul class="bulletpoints">
			 <li>If this call is associated with the different group of call track  then the convert lead option will be available again. If while converting, the same leads group as the previous converted call is assigned is selected , then these two leads will be merged and appear as one. Only the call counter in the leads section will increment. All the call history will be shown when the counter is clicked.</li>
			 <li>If while converting, a different lead group is selected then it will treated as a separate lead.</li>
